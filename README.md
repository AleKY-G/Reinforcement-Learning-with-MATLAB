# Reinforcement-Learning-RL-with-MATLAB
This repository contains series of modules to get started with Reinforcement Learning with MATLAB.

**Solutions are available upon instructor request. Please contact Melda Ulusoy (<mulusoy@mathworks.com>)**

It is divided into 4 stages.

In **Stage 1** we start with learning RL concepts by manually coding the RL problem. Later 
we see how the same thing can be done by using functions available in MathWorks 
RL toolbox.

In **Stage 2**, we deal with complex environments and learn how Deep Learning agents 
are modelled and trained. Additionally, we see how to custom build an environment 
in MATLAB.

In **Stage 3** we introduce Simulink. We develop environments using Simulink RL blocks.

In **Stage 4** brings us to additional environments of Mechanical and Industrial 
Engineering problems, that we will build using the concepts taught before.

Please go through the folder named 'Introduction and Documentation' to get started with the modules.
You can view the MATLAB script by opening the PDF associated with that repective module.
