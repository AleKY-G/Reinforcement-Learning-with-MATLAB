Creating an MDP MATLAB Environment with a Q learning Agent

GOAL:- Reach to the nearest terminal point as quickly as possible
Action:-  The agent can either move towards left or right
States: A total of 8 states with 2 terminal states and 6 non terminal states
Reward: All nonterminal states have a small negative reward and terminal states have a large positive reward

Assumptions:
Agent has to move around, cannot stop at one place.
All actions are deterministic and result into exact execution.
